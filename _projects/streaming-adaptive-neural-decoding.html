To better model temporal patterns in neural activity as it relates to ongoing motor behavior, we
develop streaming algorithms through a probabilistic sequence decoding framework. Our goal is
to obtain latent dynamical models that can flexibly adapt to ongoing distributional shifts. Through
this framework, we aim to improve the stability or adaptability of BCI decoders across time and
task, thus reducing or eliminating the need for frequent re-calibration. <br>

    experimental neural data. Performance of neural
    decoders goes down as a function of drift. Our
    algorithm PSD maintains performance by
    adapting to the changed neural dynamics.
