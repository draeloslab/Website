We develop new models of low-dimensional neural and behavioral data through manifold
construction and adaptation during diverse tasks or stimulus conditions. While many latent
space models are fit after a recording is over, we instead focus on the real-time domain to learn
ongoing latent dynamics as data are acquired, and to learn response maps for how these
dynamics are perturbed under arbitrary stimuli. We also develop new constrained optimization
methods to determine best high-dimensional stimulation patterns to drive neural dynamics in
latent spaces.<br>
