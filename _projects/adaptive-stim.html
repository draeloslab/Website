We develop new models of low-dimensional neural and behavioral data through manifold construction and adaptation during diverse tasks or stimulus conditions. 
While many latent space models are fit after a recording is over, we instead focus on the real-time domain to learn ongoing latent dynamics as data are acquired, and to learn response maps for how these dynamics are perturbed under arbitrary stimuli. 
We also develop new constrained optimization methods to determine best high-dimensional stimulation patterns to drive neural dynamics in latent spaces.<br>
