How can we get connectivity between large systems of neurons in vivo?
Using stimulations of small ensembles and a statistical method called group testing, we show in our recent <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/531d29a813ef9471aad0a5558d449a73-Abstract.html">paper</a> that this is now feasible even in networks of up to 10 thousand neurons.
