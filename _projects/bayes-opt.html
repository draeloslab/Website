<!-- We apply Bayesian Optimization techniques that improve information transfer when using visual stimulation.  -->
We apply machine learning and Bayesian Optimization techniques to estimate neural responses to high-dimensional visual stimuli in real-time.
This approach adaptively selects the next stimulus to test, potentially speeding up results exponentially. In collaboration with the [Savier](https://www.savierlab.com/), [Burgess](https://www.burgesslab.org/), 
and [Naumann](https://www.naumannlab.org/) labs, we aim to use streaming software platforms, like <i>improv</i> ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432006v2), [Github](https://github.com/project-improv/improv/tree/main)) to run adaptive experiements where we can gain insights into the current 
brain state in real-time and use this information to dynamically adjust an experiment's while data collection is ongoing. 
By briding the gap between simplistic and complex stimulus spaces, these methods could provide new insights into how sensory stimuli are represented in the brains of behaving animals.
