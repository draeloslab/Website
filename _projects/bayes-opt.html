We apply machine learning and Bayesian Optimization techniques to estimate neural responses to high-dimensional visual stimuli in real-time.
This approach adaptively selects the next stimulus to test, potentially speeding up results exponentially. In collaboration with the [Savier](https://www.savierlab.com/), [Burgess](https://www.burgesslab.org/), 
and [Naumann](https://www.naumannlab.org/) labs, we use our streaming software platform,  <i>improv</i> ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432006v2), [Github](https://github.com/project-improv/improv/tree/main)) to run adaptive experiements where we can gain insights into the current 
brain state in real-time and use this information to dynamically adjust an experiment while data collection is ongoing. 
By briding the gap between simplistic and complex stimulus spaces, these methods could provide new insights into how sensory stimuli are represented in the brains of behaving animals. <br>
