We develop models for real-time analysis of signals for brain-computer interfaces that incorporate neural stimulations. 
In collaboration with the [Chestek Lab](https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu), we use a markerless deep learning based tracking tool called [DeepLabCut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) to automatically extract positions and calculate joint positions of non-human primates. 
We aim to integrate this system with existing brain-computer interface paradigms and to automatically optimize high-dimensional stimulation patterns in real time.<br>

We also examine latent representations of neural data that are stable across sequential time points, and design new alignment methods for these representations across days to create latent spaces that are stable across both short and long timescales. 
By training and running a decoding model using these modified datasets, we aim to improve the long term stability of BCI decoders, thus reducing or eliminating the need for frequent re-calibration.<br>
