We develop models for real-time analysis of signals for brain-computer interfaces that incorporate neural stimulations. 
In collaboration with the [Chestek Lab](https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu), we use markerless deep
learning based tracking to automatically extract positions and calculate joint positions of the
fingers of non-human primates. We use this system to replace physical devices like
manipulanda during brain-computer interface tasks to allow for freer movements and more
naturalistic behavior patterns. We also use this system to provide immediate feedback of joint
angles and finger and wrist positions during functional electrical stimulation (FES) to
automatically optimize high-dimensional stimulation patterns in real time. <br>

<small><i> Figure: (Top) Experimental setup with multiple camera views. Processing speeds for inferring
    finger and wrist angles are faster than image acquisition. (Bottom) The map of reachable poses
    observed from user-selected stimulation patterns agrees with our simulated model.
