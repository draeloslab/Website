We develop models for real-time analysis of signals for brain-computer interfaces that incorporate neural stimulations. 
In collaboration with the [Chestek Lab](https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu), we use a markerless deep learning based tracking tool called [DeepLabCut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) (Mathis, 2018) to automatically extract joint positions of non-human primates. 
We've used this system to analyze the effects of fatigue in functional electrical stimulation and characterized its structured stimulation-response relationships. 
We aim to integrate this system with existing brain-computer interface paradigms and to automatically optimize high-dimensional stimulation patterns in real time.
