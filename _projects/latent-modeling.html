We investigate techniques for efficient modeling and computation of latent spaces in neural and behavioral data.
We hypothesize that the relationship between neural circuitry and behavior is mediated through low-dimensional dynamical patterns embedded in the neural activity of the brain. 
The adaptive latent project aims to extract and analyze these patterns, or latent variables, as they unfold using streaming machine learning algorithms, like [Bubblewrap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13941).
Constructing these latents in real-time will also allow us to model and design stimulations which we can use to test causal hypotheses about the latent variables we discover, both in-house experiements 
and in collaboration with experimentalists.<br>

In collaboration with the [Kaczorowski Lab](https://kaczorowski.lab.medicine.umich.edu/), we also develop probabilistic multimodal models to uncover latent factors in complex datasets, crucial for research in neuroscience and genetics. Using variational autoencoders (VAEs), 
we integrate various data types, such as transciptomics and behavioral data, to explore interactions between different factors. We aim to capture hidden 
structures by modelling long-tail distributions and introducing hyper-priors to emulate an infinite mixture of Gaussians.
