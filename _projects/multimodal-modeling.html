We work on multimodal integration and probabilistic models to uncover latent factors across neural, genetic, and behavioral datasets. 
In collaboration with the [Kaczorowski Lab](https://kaczorowski.lab.medicine.umich.edu/), we are developing new variational autoencoder architectures to identify novel factors underlying 
cognitive resilience in Alzheimer’s disease. We then integrate optimized trajectory modeling techniques to propose novel interventions (genetic, environmental) based on these structured
latent spaces. See our recent publication [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44400-025-00042-y).<br>

    shows the spectrum of cognitive resilience. (Right) Cognitive metrics (CFM) can be
    continuously generated along a path from susceptible to resilient (solid) or vice versa (dashed).
