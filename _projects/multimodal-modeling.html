In collaboration with the [Kaczorowski Lab](https://kaczorowski.lab.medicine.umich.edu/), we also develop probabilistic multimodal models to uncover latent factors in complex datasets, crucial for research in neuroscience and genetics. Using variational autoencoders (VAEs), 
we integrate various data types, such as transciptomics and behavioral data, to explore interactions between different factors. We aim to capture hidden 
structures by modelling long-tail distributions and introducing hyper-priors to emulate an infinite mixture of Gaussians.
