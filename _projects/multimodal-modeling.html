We work on multimodal integration and probabilistic models to uncover latent factors across neural, genetic, and behavioral datasets. 
In collaboration with the [Kaczorowski Lab](https://kaczorowski.lab.medicine.umich.edu/), we are developing new variational autoencoder architectures to identify novel factors underlying cognitive resilience in Alzheimer's disease. 
We also develop trajectory modeling techniques to propose novel interventions (genetic, environmental) based on structured latent spaces.<br>
