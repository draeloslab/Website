The [2025 BME Summer Workshop](https://bme.umich.edu/bme-summer-workshops-michigan/#overview), July 23-24, focused on the Future of Neurotechnology and brought together leading researchers, clinicians, and students to discuss "emerging tools and approaches shaping the future of brain research and innovation."

Anne presented the lab's research during the session on "Computational & AI/ML Techniques."

This year, the workshop hosted its first student Hackathon, where students gathered in teams and worked to solve a research question of their choosingbased on data they were given. Congrats to <b>Lucy</b> and her team for winning the Hackathon with their project "Can we detect abnormal brain activty before a seizure occurs?"

The workshop also hosted a NETP-sponsored Poster Session which showcased ongoing work from trainees and faculty. Congrats to <b>Jake</b> for being a poster session winner with his poster on "Using Markerless Motion Tracking for Real-Time Functional Electrical Stimulation Optimization"
