                    We develop statistically efficient methods for real-time and adaptive neuroscience experiments.
                    We construct latent models from high-dimensional neural, behavioral, genetic, and other data as
                    a form of simplification (learning underlying patterns) and as a means of combining data across
                    modalities (multi-modal integration). These models are typically learned in a streaming setting,
                    one data point at a time, to allow us to track changes in data dynamically across time or
                    condition. We then also combine these with closed-loop optimization strategies for designing
                    stimulations in real time, both external (visual) and internal (direct neural perturbations).
